# ReadyLayer2-Hackathon
A dApp made for the Ready Layer 2 hackathon.

## Setup
Clone the repository, then run `npm install` from within both the `frontend` folder and `backend` folder.

## Local test
From inside the `frontend` folder, run `npm run dev`. This will start up the Next.js frontend, where you can interact with the app and smart contracts.
